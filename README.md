# grubdash

GrubDash : Food Delivery On Demand : A Thinkful project.

For this project I built a RESTful API for a food delivery service called GrubDash.

This Project was developed using JavaScript, Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL.

Instructions : 
You've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash! 
As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, 
you have been tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that 
the frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas for the big bosses.
